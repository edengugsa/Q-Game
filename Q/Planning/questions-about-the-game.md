# SUBJECT: Questions regarding The Q Game

Hi there,

These are our questions regarding your idea for The Q Game...

- Can there be ties? Should there be a way to settle a tie?
- How would the Referee ever run out of tiles? 
- Since the referee disqualifies players for violating rules, does this imply
there is no opportunity to "try again" after submitting an invalid move?
